## Overview

## My process

I started by reading through all the documents and seeing what resources were provided in this project. After I felt like I had a good grasp on what was expected, I started to plan out what I needed to write to make it happen. I began creating classses and styles to make things the correct colors and sizes. I added my image and tags for the different sections of my code. I didn't know how to add the correct font, round the corners, or center the text, so I headed to the internet to find some answers. I managed to find plenty of useful resources on that, so I proceeded to get those elements added correctly. At this point I was nearly finished with the project, but there was a little more troubleshooting left to do in order to make everything the exact matching proportions from the example images. After working on that for a bit, I was finally happy with the results.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This is the first project I have made using HTML and CSS. I've been going through some online tutorials and I was ready to get started practicing the concepts I've read about. This project helped me learn about putting items in containers and how adjusting those containers can change what's inside. I learned more about how to use classes to conveniently change characteristics of my project.


### Continued development

I plan to continue going through tutorials to learn more concepts and apply them in Frontend Mentor projects. I would like to learn more about how to use separate CSS files to define classes instead of writing all the CSS above my HTML code.


### Useful resources

- [Educational Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This site helped me learn some inital HTML and CSS to begin working on this project.
- [Color Resource](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) - This is a great reference for color names in HTML.
- [Tags Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) - This page is helpful to reference tags you may forget while learning how to write HTML
